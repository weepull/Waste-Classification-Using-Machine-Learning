# Waste Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying waste into different categories using Machine Learning techniques. Proper waste classification is crucial for effective recycling and reducing environmental impact.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Waste_Classification_EDITED_VIPUL_73%.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `waste_images/` – Dataset folder containing categorized waste images (e.g., organic, recyclable, hazardous, etc.).
- `models/` – Folder for saved models or checkpoints.
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.
- `.gitignore` – Ignores unnecessary files like checkpoints and cache.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains labeled images across several waste categories:
- Organic
- Recyclable
- Hazardous
- General Waste

Organized as:
```
waste_images/
├── organic/
├── recyclable/
├── hazardous/
└── general/
```

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Model** – A CNN model trained to classify the waste types.
3. **Evaluation** – Achieved 73% accuracy on the validation/test set.
4. **Prediction** – Accepts image input and predicts the waste category.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-classification-ml.git
   cd waste-classification-ml
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Waste_Classification_EDITED_VIPUL_73%.ipynb
   ```

## 🧠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional)

## 📈 Results

- **Validation Accuracy**: 73%
- Confusion matrix and metrics shown in the notebook.

## 🔧 Future Work

- Improve accuracy with better augmentation and more data.
- Add GUI or web app for live waste classification.
- Deploy model on edge devices for real-time use.
